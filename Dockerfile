# Fly.io entry point — installs workspace deps (SvelteKit never enters the
# image). NOTE: Bun validates the ENTIRE workspace graph against the lockfile,
# so all workspace package.jsons must be copied before install (documented Bun
# gotcha — see plan/notes.md).
#
# IMPORTANT: do NOT use `bun install --filter memory-server` here — the root
# workspace's own deps (tmcp, etc.) are NOT installed by --filter (it only
# matches workspace members), so the server fails with "Cannot find package
# 'tmcp'". A plain install is required.
